This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# React | React Landing Page

## Introduction

We just learned the basics about creating an app in React with create-react-app, so we will use this exercise to re-do what we just learned (and hopefully to add some style :blossom: ).

![reactjs-landing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23629340/43717301-63db38d2-9987-11e8-81a6-34ea48342663.png)

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.


## Instructions

### Iteration 1 - Create the App

Let's start with the basics: as you can see `public` folder is already there and it has some images in it. We will have to move these images to the `public` folder from create-react-app. Also, remember that the `index.html` file is where you will have the entry point of the application.


#### Babel and Webpack

Our project needs to have two important packages that are necessary for compiling: `Babel` and `Webpack`.

But don't worry, create-react-app will take care of it.


### Iteration 2 - React Creation

  ```
  npx creacte-react-app my-first-react-app
  cd to my-first-react-app
  npm start
  ```

## Iteration 3 - First Landing Page

Finally, let's create our landing page. In the `public` folder, you will find all the assets you need to recreate the following landing page:

![home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23629340/43718926-863a3c7a-998c-11e8-803b-7c9bc87425bb.png)

For now, don't worry about creating more than one component, we will cover that in the following lessons!

Happy coding! :heart:
